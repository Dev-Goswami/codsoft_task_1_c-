This is my internship project, where I created a Number Guessing Game using C++. In this game, I used ANSI escape codes to design a console-based UI that enhances the user's experience with color-coded feedback.

In the game, the user is asked to choose a difficulty level: Easy, Medium, or Hard. Based on the selected level, the game generates a random number, and the user has to guess it.

If the user's guess is less than the actual number, the game prints "Too Low" in red color.

If the guess is higher than the actual number, it prints "Too High" in green color.

The user is given a maximum of 11 attempts to guess the number.

If the user fails to guess the number in 11 attempts, the game reveals the correct number at the end.

After each game, the user is asked whether they want to play again or exit.

I have also used system-based screen clearing to ensure cross-platform support for a smoother experience.
